# db-dump-lib.sh — shared helpers for the per-stack db-dump.sh scripts.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file used to be vendored from the restic repository (now
# backup-restic-push), which carried the authoritative copy. That copy is
# gone: the restic side no longer dumps databases at all — one job per script —
# so THIS is now the only implementation and the place to change it.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is NOT a standalone program: it is meant to be "source"d from a stack's
# db-dump.sh (see ../examples/ for thin wrappers). It centralises the generic
# parts that used to be copy-pasted into every dump script:
#   - creating the db-dumps/ directory,
#   - rotating/deleting old dumps (retention),
#   - timestamped dump filenames,
#   - logging in the run format of backup-docker-db.sh.
#
# The DB-specific bit (which command, which container, user/db) stays in each
# stack's db-dump.sh, which calls the dump_* helpers below.
#
# Context variables — resolved with defaults so a wrapper works BOTH standalone
# (./db-dump.sh) and when launched by backup-docker-db.sh:
#   STACK_DIR   directory of the calling db-dump.sh (the stack). Derived from the
#               caller's path when not set in the environment.
#   STACK_NAME  used in log messages and as the container name prefix. Defaults
#               to the stack directory name. backup-docker-db.sh sets this.
#   RETENTION_DAYS  days to keep dumps; set per stack in the wrapper (default 30).
#
# ${BASH_SOURCE[1]} is the file that sourced us (the wrapper), so STACK_DIR is the
# stack directory in both the standalone and the orchestrated case.
: "${STACK_DIR:=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[1]}")" && pwd)}"
: "${STACK_NAME:=$(basename "$STACK_DIR")}"
# ":=" (local modification, see the header): keeps the upstream default when the
# caller says nothing, but lets backup-docker-db.sh redirect the dumps into the
# central STAGING_DIR. All dump_* helpers read DUMP_DIR at CALL time, so an
# orchestrator that loops over stacks can also re-assign it per stack.
: "${DUMP_DIR:=$STACK_DIR/db-dumps}"

# Log in the same format as backup-docker-db.sh ("<ts> [LEVEL] msg"). No log file is
# written here — backup-docker-db.sh captures this script's stdout/stderr. Logs go
# to STDERR on purpose: _resolve_container returns the container id on stdout via
# a command substitution, so its diagnostics must not pollute that channel.

  # do not pile up forever. Call ONCE before the dump_* helpers. RETENTION_DAYS
  # is set per stack in the wrapper (default 30), KEEP_MIN likewise (default 2).
  #
  # KEEP_MIN is the part a plain "find -mtime +N -delete" gets wrong: a database
  # that has not been dumped for a while — a stack that was down, a dump that
  # kept failing — would have all its files expire on the same day and leave the
  # stack with nothing at all. The newest KEEP_MIN dumps are therefore protected
  # regardless of age. Local retention is short anyway; the actual history lives
  # in the backup repositories.
  #
  # "Newest" is decided by the timestamp IN THE FILE NAME (%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S),
  # which sorts lexically exactly as it sorts chronologically. That avoids
  # GNU-only "find -printf" (this also has to work on a busybox host) and it
  # survives a copy that did not preserve mtimes.
  #
  # The protection is per NAME PREFIX, not per directory: a stack with several

# --- container discovery & dump finalisation ---------------------------------

# "${STACK_NAME}-<suffix>". Instead they resolve the target through docker
# compose run FROM THE STACK DIRECTORY, so a custom "container_name:" or project
# name no longer breaks anything and the stack's docker-compose.yml needs no
# edits. Resolution order (most explicit first):
#   DB_CONTAINER  raw container name/id, used verbatim (bypasses compose)
#   DB_SERVICE / first arg   a compose service name -> docker compose ps -q
#   auto-detect   the project's running container that looks like the engine
#                 (image name / exposed port / engine env var — so postgres
#                 derivatives like pgvecto-rs are found too)

# no bind mount (db-dumps/ -> /tmp/dumps) is required inside the container.
