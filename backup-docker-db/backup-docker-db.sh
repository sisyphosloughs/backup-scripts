# backup-docker-db.sh — script 1 of the pull-backup architecture.
#
# Creates the database dumps of all configured Docker stacks LOCALLY on the
# SOURCE host and publishes them under STAGING_DIR. It never talks to a backup
# target: no restic, no repository credential, no outbound connection except the
# Telegram notification. The BACKUP host pulls STAGING_DIR read-only and runs
# restic there. That separation is the whole point of the split — a compromised
# SOURCE can neither alter existing backups nor write into the backup zone — and
# must not be weakened here ("push it directly, it's simpler" is not an option).
#
# The only coupling to the pull side is one narrow contract: the marker file
# STAGING_DIR/.complete. It is written atomically at the end of a run and ONLY
# when every configured stack was dumped without a single error. A missing or
# stale marker tells the pull side: do not use this staging directory.
#
# Nothing is hard-coded here; every path, stack and switch comes from:
#   global.conf         run-wide switches (paths, retention, Telegram, …)
#   instances/<name>.conf  one file per stack to dump — a new stack needs no
#                       change to this script
#   lib/db-dump-lib.sh  vendored dump helpers (container autodetection,
#                       credential resolution, retention) — see its header
#   lib/runlib/         the shared run skeleton (log file, error account, lock,
#                       configuration loader, summary, notification, marker),
#                       a git submodule shared with the other backup scripts
# all relative to this script's directory. Needs docker access (run as root).

Options:
  -i, --instance NAME  Dump only this stack (repeatable). A partial run NEVER
                       writes the completion marker — use it for testing a new
                       instances/<name>.conf, not for scheduled runs.
  -l, --list           List the configured stacks and exit.
  -h, --help           Show this help and exit.

Exit code: 0 only if the run was completely error-free.
